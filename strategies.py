Strategy layer: entry signals + exit ladder.

Single-leg short premium. The classifier in data.py picks one side per evaluation;
this module turns that signal into a Position and manages it through the exit
ladder. No state held outside Position itself — the engine re-evaluates every bar.

Exit ladder (first to fire wins, checked in this order):
    1. expiration           T <= 0  →  settle intrinsic
    2. max loss             pnl <= -max_loss_mult * credit
    3. daily profit capture pnl/days >= daily_capture_mult * (credit / dte_at_entry)
    4. profit target        pnl >= profit_target * credit
    5. delta breach         |delta| > delta_breach
    6. DTE stop             dte_remaining <= dte_stop (longer-dated only)
    7. regime flip          puts close on reversal/bearish; calls close on bullish
