# TSLA / TSLL Options Premium Selling — Backtest Engine + Live Tracker

A research harness for designing and validating short-premium options strategies on TSLA and TSLL, plus a live daily-recommendation engine.

## Quick start

```bash
just setup                            # one-time: venv + deps (yfinance, scipy, pandas, pyyaml, …)
just test                             # today's live recommendation for TSLA + TSLL
just run                              # Streamlit dashboard (Today / Positions / Performance / Scenarios)
just backtest                         # full 5y backtest on TSLA + TSLL with per-ticker config
just scenarios                        # 12-regime stress-test (REQUIRED before/after strategy tweaks)
just optimize                         # walk-forward grid search over StrategyConfig knobs
just optimize -- --static             # walk-forward VALIDATION of current per-ticker defaults
just sweep KNOB --values v1,v2,v3     # reusable single-knob sweep (the LLM-critic harness)
just positions                        # status of open positions (per positions.yaml, gitignored)
just positions example                # write a sample positions.yaml template
just positions add ...                # append a position (see `just positions add --help`)
```

## Source-of-truth documents

These three files are kept current. Everything else in the repo is either code or legacy notes.

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [**GOAL.md**](GOAL.md) | The end-state goal — data-driven critic loop, success criteria, sequenced milestones. Use as `/goal` input in new sessions. |
| [**ENGINE.md**](ENGINE.md) | The backtest harness — modules, data flow, pricing assumptions, event loop semantics, known limitations, roadmap |
| [**STRATEGY.md**](STRATEGY.md) | The trading rules — entry logic, exit ladder (incl. daily profit capture formula), `StrategyConfig` defaults, latest baseline results, next tuning targets |

Both follow the same convention: **current state at the top, dated history at the bottom.**

## Session arc (2026-05-12 to 2026-05-14)

Strategy went from **v1.1 (−$6,242 on TSLA 5y, $12,292 max DD, profit factor 0.87)** to
**v1.13 (+$17,790 on TSLA 5y, $1,107 max DD, profit factor 5.25, 92% win rate)** —
a +$24,032 swing with 91% DD reduction, via the LLM-critic loop and a fleet of 5
empirically-validated adaptive rules.

- **v1.9** introduces the *symmetric direction* rule: regime tells us which side of
  the chain to sell (bullish/neutral → put, bearish → call), then per-ticker DTE ×
  delta tunes for reversal-resistance.
- **v1.10** decouples *exits* from entry signals per ticker. TSLA drops the
  `regime_flip` exit (+$2,214 P/L from letting positions ride to profit-based exits
  instead of being prematurely closed on regime change). TSLL effectively disables
  the `max_loss` dollar-threshold stop — the leveraged-ETF `delta_breach=0.45` is
  the real tail protection.
- **v1.11** lands the *adaptive-rules architecture* — `adapt_entry_params(row, cfg)`
  hook that lets context-aware rules adjust entry params on each bar using all
  available features. No rule ships in v1.11; the architecture is the extension
  point.
- **v1.12** wires the *data-driven proposer* — `analyze.py` ingests trade-log +
  feature-panel + greeks-at-entry, ranks features by effect size, emits rule
  sketches in hook syntax. Ships `tsll_skip_marginal_up` (first adaptive rule)
  validated triple-win.
- **v1.13** (this session) brings the loop to *production:* analyzer extensions
  (`--scan-narrow` with BH-FDR correction, `--pairs` for 2-feature interactions),
  per-position knob overrides (M4), an exit-side adaptive hook (M5), the
  `validate_rule.py` A/B harness, and **4 new adaptive rules** all surfaced
  directly by the analyzer:
  - `tsla_skip_mild_intraday_up` — skip when 0.5% ≤ intraday_return ≤ 1.6%
    (triple-win: +$1,511 P/L, −$749 DD, +$1,604 OOS)
  - `tsll_skip_tuesday` — skip Tuesday entries (3-of-4 surfaces positive)
  - `tsll_skip_post_earnings_drift` — skip 11–21 days after earnings (triple-win)
  - `tsll_skip_downtrend_high_iv` — pair conjunction `ret_14d × iv_rank`
    (triple-win, from `--pairs` scan)
  5 rules total; GOAL.md success criteria reached.
