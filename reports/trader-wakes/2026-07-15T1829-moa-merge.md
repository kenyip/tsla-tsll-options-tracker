CHOSE: reconcile challenger judgment for the frozen post-earnings signed-continuation mechanism, repair evidence-methodology nits without reopening strategy search, reproduce the decision on current code, and prepare one schema-v2 handoff.

## Strategy decision

ECONOMIC MECHANISM: Earnings resolve concentrated information uncertainty, but interpretation may diffuse slowly enough for the signed first completed post-announcement move to continue over five sessions versus earlier same-symbol, same-sign, non-event reactions.

CANDIDATE/FAMILY: `POST_EARNINGS_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_DRIFT_CALL_DEBIT_21D_V1` / `POST_EARNINGS_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_DRIFT` on frozen AAPL, AMD, SMCI, TSLA, META, GOOGL, ARM, NVDA. The panel is a present-day liquid operating-company screen with survivorship/listing bias; TSLL is excluded because it has no issuer earnings event.

PLANNED STRUCTURE ONLY: conditional one-lot 21-DTE `$2`-wide call debit spread after a positive first-session reaction or put debit spread after a negative reaction. Intended exposure is bounded signed delta/convexity; dangerous exposures are post-event IV crush, theta/gamma, gaps, and two-leg liquidity. `capital_fit_usd=$200`, one-lot `max_loss_usd=$200` before closing friction, `max_lots=1`, one global earnings-risk unit.

FUNNEL: `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`
OUTCOME: `FAMILY_CLOSED`
STRATEGY ADVANCEMENT: false
AUTHORITY: discovery/L0 only; no L1, leader, capital seat, registry promotion, paper force, shadow, arm, broker, or live action.

PREDECLARED FALSIFIER: close at F0 if explicit timing/control support is non-vacuous but train has fewer than 40 pairs or 6 symbols; event mean does not exceed control; paired mean or one-sided 90% five-pair circular-block-bootstrap lower bound is non-positive; hit-rate edge is below 5 percentage points; or chronology, overlap, source-hash, strict-JSON, outcome-unread, or numeric integrity fails.

## Economic result

Tracked current-code claim: `reports/trader-wakes/moa/2026-07-15T1829/post-earnings-information-drift-train.json`

- 298 retrospective timestamped events; 126 matched blueprints.
- Train `75` pairs across `7` symbols; holdout `51` remains outcome-unread.
- Event signed five-session mean: `-0.0048312306693351955`.
- Control signed five-session mean: `-0.0018400686017785396`.
- Paired mean: `-0.0029911620675566564`; median `0.007205961204603817`; positive frequency `0.5333333333333333`.
- One-sided 90% five-pair block-bootstrap lower bound: `-0.016153603629205513`.
- Event/control continuation hit rates: `0.4533333333333333` / `0.4666666666666667`; edge `-0.013333333333333364`.
- Integrity violations `[]`; option pricing calls `0`.
- Current-code tracked/cache replay normalized SHA-256: `68454675f609da13816fa55f0a577027516b25d511bd5869baa200f8f62f7441`; tracked raw SHA-256 `df7e80547438e6c7577e82c13de42c6419e61ad2fbfdf489431ac501e0d802c5`.

Density and breadth passed, but absolute event expectancy, event-versus-control mean, paired mean, uncertainty lower bound, and hit-rate edge failed. Positive median/frequency did not overcome adverse tails. The exact unconditional family is quarantined without spending the holdout.

## Challenger reconciliation

Accepted and repaired:
1. Accepted `PASS WITH NITS` and the exact F0 family close; no strategy search or option stage was reopened.
2. Kept the retrospective-versus-point-in-time boundary explicit. Current Yahoo timestamps support post-announcement BMO/AMC alignment only, never historical known-at/pre-event scheduling alpha.
3. Serialized per-pair calendar/reaction/ret20/hv20 match gaps plus max/median geometry and a diagnostic-only >=10% absolute paired-excess count. Current train: calendar max/median `420/70` sessions and extreme count `15/75`. Coarse/extreme matching narrows causal precision but cannot rescue a family whose absolute event expectancy and all signed economic gates fail.
4. Added a zero-control-support negative control that fails before bootstrap with strict JSON nulls.
5. Preserved sparse SMCI, survivor/listing bias, no option/cost/fill evidence, and no subset salvage.
6. Updated readiness to no-advance streak `3`, `strategy_burst_stop_required=true`, and exactly one burst-stop reassessment NEXT. Wording now says third consecutive completed post-advance strategy wake without advancement; the breakout epoch itself completed at 1606.
7. Kept phase, B checks, registry, and capital path unchanged; living quality leader remains none.

Rejected claims:
- threshold/symbol churn, median-positive mining, holdout peeking, or SMCI subset salvage;
- pre-event scheduling/known-at authority from retrospective timestamps;
- capability/tests as strategy advancement;
- capital-seat comparison against a living leader (none exists).

No material challenger judgment was rejected; its nits were accepted and repaired or used to narrow labels.

## Verification

- Focused behavioral/boundary/negative-control/provenance/adjacent suite: `Ran 26 tests in 2.576s — OK`.
- Required final full suite after all surfaces: `unset GIT_INDEX_FILE; .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests` -> `Ran 349 tests in 17.891s — OK`. A prior post-surface attempt inherited a removed disposable-index path and exposed 11 fixture setup errors; unsetting the persisted environment restored the ordinary index and the unchanged suite passed.
- Changed Python/test `py_compile`: exit `0`.
- Current-code tracked claim/cache replay substantive equality excluding only `generated_at`: `True`; normalized SHA-256 both `68454675f609da13816fa55f0a577027516b25d511bd5869baa200f8f62f7441`.
- Income coverage regenerated under canonical run stamp `2026-07-15T1829`: 21 structures / 246 hypotheses / 70 evolve artifacts / no living leader; dated/LATEST byte-identical; redundant 1845 snapshot removed.
- Schema-v2 handoff: `ok=true`, outcome `FAMILY_CLOSED`, 4 useful deltas, 7 critic findings closed. Completion-gate regressions `38/38`; disposable-index prepare `ok=true` for 20 staged files; 16/16 source hashes; strict JSON; full 272936-byte staged diff reviewed with empty `diff --check`, zero secret-pattern hits, and no sensitive/cache/temp/log paths. Final rerun is recorded in `learning-promotion.md`; real index untouched.

## Durable lesson

Unconditional post-earnings signed continuation is not a stable income edge on this frozen high-attention panel: the event path averaged negative, underperformed matched non-event reactions, and had negative uncertainty/hit gates while a positive median concealed 15 large paired outcomes. Matched-event labs must persist geometry and zero-support semantics, and retrospective timestamps must never be promoted to point-in-time calendar authority.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

BURST_STOP_SEARCH_DESIGN_REASSESSMENT: stop strategy-experiment volume. Diagnose the 1648 breakout-expression dual-cost/path close, 1747 post-shock compression close, and 1829 post-earnings continuation close; test whether current matched-control discovery is surfacing positive-median/adverse-tail families unsuitable for one-lot defined-risk income; inventory independent non-quarantined evidence classes; then open at most one successor epoch/charter with a complete Layered Edge Stack and predeclared falsifier before another strategy experiment. Do not rerun or threshold/panel-churn the closed post-earnings, post-shock, breakout-expression, TOM, OPEX, or monthly-ranking families. No registry, paper force, shadow, arm, broker, or live action.

## Integration

Wrapper postflight passed after deterministic integration. Commit `e210370dea867953b7a0dcefc2ba65205a052ed2` is on `main` and `origin/main`; checkout was clean; completion receipt `.cache/platform/completion/2026-07-15T1829.json` recorded `integrated=true` and `pushed=true`.
