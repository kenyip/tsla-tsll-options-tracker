# Trader wake — 2026-07-15T2007 MoA finalizer

WAKE: 2026-07-15T2007
PHASE: BUILD / L0 research only
ROLE: GPT 5.6 Sol finalizer / single writer
SLEEVE: $3,000 Agentic research sleeve
STATUS: `RUN COMPLETE`; integrated, pushed, and postflight-complete
CHOSE: reconcile the challenger `PASS WITH NITS`, repair the claim-bearing specificity label and holdout wording, preserve the exact family close, rewrite living readiness/NEXT surfaces, verify current-code evidence, and prepare one schema-v2 handoff.

## Strategy decision

ECONOMIC MECHANISM: Persistent cross-sectional left-tail heterogeneity from sector cyclicality, concentration, and risk-transfer demand should make the lowest prior downside-semivariance ETF less likely than the highest-ranked control to breach a 5% ten-session close barrier inside a lag-safe SPY uptrend.

CANDIDATE/FAMILY: `LOW_DOWNSIDE_SEMIVARIANCE_ETF_PCS_21D_V1` / `noncollapse|cross_section_low_downside_semivariance_60d|liquid_etfs_spy_qqq_iwm_xlf_xle_xlk_xli_xlv|spy_sma100_uptrend_positive60d|10session_close_barrier5pct|pcs21d2wide_planned`.

PLANNED STRUCTURE ONLY: conditional one-lot nearest-listed 18–24 DTE `$2`-wide PCS on the selected ETF; short one 0.18–0.25 delta put, buy the same-expiry put `$2` lower, require at least `$0.30` credit, positive bids, and two-leg NBBO width at most `$0.20`. Intended positive delta/theta, short vega, bounded short gamma; dangerous correlation spike, gap-through-wing, volatility/skew expansion, assignment/dividend, composition drift, and two-leg liquidity. `capital_fit_usd=$200`, structural one-lot `max_loss_usd=$200` before credit/closing friction, `max_lots=1`, one global bullish risk unit.

FUNNEL: `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`
OUTCOME: `FAMILY_CLOSED`
STRATEGY ADVANCEMENT: false
AUTHORITY: fixed-panel adjusted-close L0 only; no F1/F2/L1, quality leader, capital seat, registry, paper, shadow, arm, broker, or live action.

PREDECLARED FALSIFIER: close on insufficient density/breadth; low-rank 5% breach above 10%; high-minus-low edge below five percentage points; non-positive date-block LB90; no milder low-rank worst-decile path; semivariance edge no stronger than same-date plain HV; or chronology, overlap, source hash, population, finite-value, strict-JSON, unread-holdout, or integrity failure.

## Economic result

Tracked claim: `reports/trader-wakes/moa/2026-07-15T2007/downside-semivariance-etf-train.json`

- Panel: present-day `SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, XLK, XLI, XLV`; adjusted-close common window 2010-01-04 through 2026-07-14; 4,156 rows; all eight persisted source hashes stable.
- Train: `178` globally non-overlapping rank dates from 2010-08-02 through 2019-10-29; low/high breadth `8/7`; integrity `[]`.
- Holdout: `119` blueprints with rank dates 2019-11-13 through 2026-06-16 and exits through 2026-07-02; outcome-unread identity `72a6d18430031f03421d27a2680f53d42f099357a5c6685b1b3db2ce1a7dcd5d`; pricing calls `0`.
- Low/high 5% breach: `4.4944% / 11.2360%`; semivariance edge `+6.7416pp`; one-sided 90% complete-rank-date block LB `+3.9326pp`.
- Low/high worst-decile minimum close return: `-4.9172% / -8.0647%`.
- Plain-HV edge: `+7.8652pp`; semivariance-minus-plain-HV margin `-1.1236pp`; same low/high selection on `134/178` and `141/178` dates.
- Sole failed gate: `semivariance_edge_exceeds_plain_hv`.

The exact family closed on mechanism non-specificity only. Absolute hazard, relative separation, uncertainty, tail, breadth, density, and integrity passed, but the specialized left-tail second moment did not improve separation over the simpler total-volatility rank and overlapped it heavily. Positive absolute quality cannot identify the semivariance-specific mechanism.

## Evidence boundaries

- The panel is fixed and present-day, with survivorship, listing-history, composition-change, overlapping-fund, and concentration limits. Low ranks were concentrated in SPY (`83/178`) and XLV (`60/178`); high ranks in XLE (`107/178`). This does not invalidate the exact F0 close but blocks broad selection/generalization claims.
- Daily-close barriers can miss intraday lows and are not option marks, executable stops, managed PCS PnL, or fill evidence.
- The labeled 20-bps underlying sensitivity is diagnostic only and is not option cost evidence.
- Holdout outcomes and option pricing remain sealed; no expiration, strike, credit, NBBO, assignment, IV/skew, or fill edge was tested.

## Challenger reconciliation

Accepted and repaired:
1. Accepted `PASS WITH NITS` and exact `FAMILY_CLOSED` disposition.
2. Repaired the payload's dominant-failure overstatement. Current code emits mechanism non-specificity only when that is the sole failed gate; the focused negative control rejects `absolute` wording on this path.
3. Tightened holdout dates to distinguish last rank date 2026-06-16 from final exit 2026-07-02.
4. Fully rewrote readiness for stamp 2007 rather than retaining the 1912 decision with only NEXT patched.
5. Adopted the merged SPY index theta-carry pivot, active-epoch no-advance streak `2`, and `strategy_pivot_required=true`; a third consecutive no-advance requires burst-stop reassessment.
6. Preserved semivariance/lookback/barrier/panel quarantine, recent-downshock and low-HV mean-return quarantines, and sealed holdout `72a6d184…`.

Rejected claims:
- executor plain-HV barrier continuation as the durable NEXT;
- any implication that absolute hazard success nearly earned F1;
- any broad ETF-selection/capital claim from the concentrated fixed panel;
- any F1/F2/L1, capital-seat, registry, paper, shadow, arm, broker, or live reading.

No material challenger strategy judgment was rejected; invalid/stale state and promotion implications were rejected because final surfaces disprove them.

## Verification

- focused strategy suite: `Ran 7 tests in 0.137s — OK`.
- focused finalizer-adjacent suite: `Ran 57 tests in 7.523s — OK`.
- required full suite: `Ran 363 tests in 18.244s — OK`.
- compile and CLI-help smoke: exit `0`, no output.
- current-code replay: `FAMILY_CLOSED`; train `178`; failed gate exactly `semivariance_edge_exceeds_plain_hv`; tracked/fresh substantive equality excluding only `generated_at`; normalized SHA-256 `2f1dc94161b361b1725f92d91eb63b32dc0686d87a7f52bf582a24e123cf48a2`; all source hashes and holdout identity equal.
- derived coverage: `21` structures / `246` hypotheses / `70` evolve artifacts / no leader; dated `2007` and LATEST byte-identical.
- schema-v2 handoff: `ok=true`, `role_ready=true`, outcome `FAMILY_CLOSED`, four useful deltas, six critic findings closed.
- complete 20-path diff/security review and disposable-index completion prepare: diff check clean; prepare `ok=true`, branch `trader/run-2026-07-15T2007`, staged files `20`; no sensitive/private/unintended path found.

## Durable lesson

A specialized downside-risk selector can pass absolute hazard, relative separation, uncertainty, tail, breadth, and chronology yet fail to identify its economic mechanism when a simpler same-date total-risk rank performs better. Persist exact failed gates, label sole failures precisely, test the isolated path, keep holdout/options sealed, and pivot after the second no-advance rather than promoting the inspected comparator under a new family label.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

`SPY_INDEX_THETA_CARRY_PCS_21D_DUAL_COST_F0`: freeze a regime-only SPY one-lot 18–24 DTE `$2`-wide PCS (short 0.18–0.25 delta, minimum `$0.30` credit, positive bids, two-leg NBBO width `≤$0.20` when quotes exist, 50% harvest, 5% underlying-close invalidation, hard approximately ten-session stop), `capital_fit_usd=$200`, structural `max_loss_usd=$200` before credit/friction, `max_lots=1`; evaluate chronological train then untouched holdout proxy option path PnL under both 5% adverse leg slip and `$0.01`-per-leg half-spread with non-vacuous trade, max-loss, window-DD, chronology, and integrity gates. No cross-sectional HV/semivariance rank, no use of holdout `72a6d184…`, and no L1, registry, paper force, shadow, arm, broker, or live action from proxy evidence.
