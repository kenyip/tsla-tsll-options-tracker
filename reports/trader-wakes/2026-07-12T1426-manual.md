# Trader self-sufficiency repair — 2026-07-12T1426

WAKE: 2026-07-12T1426 PDT (Sunday; market closed)
PHASE: BUILD
SLEEVE: 3000
PAPER_ONLY: true

## CHOSE

Repair the caller-dependent BUILD wake contract so Trader owns zero-input orientation and loop judgment across human, coordinator, compatibility, and active cron entrypoints.

## DID

- Made `configs/build_lab_free_goal.txt` the sole authoritative durable BUILD program goal.
- Changed `scripts/trader_build_lab_moa.sh` to load that goal on zero input, derive time/session context internally as metadata, remove synthesized slot goals, and keep explicit overrides/recovery behavior.
- Converged `just trader-build-lab`, the stress compatibility adapter, bootstrap-managed profile scripts, and all 13 active BUILD cron jobs (8 script names) on one zero-argument live profile entrypoint.
- Strengthened executor orientation from SOUL, doctrine, memory/skills, readiness, prior wake/learning, audits, current time/session, and relevant data; prior NEXT is explicitly context, never an order.
- Updated BUILD/profile/loop docs, live Trader SOUL/skill/memory, and coordinator routing without changing schedules, gateway, broker, orders, or strategy evidence.

## EVIDENCE

- Canonical goal: `configs/build_lab_free_goal.txt`
- Front door: `scripts/trader_build_lab_moa.sh`; `just trader-build-lab`
- Compatibility/bootstrap: `scripts/trader_wake_moa.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap_trader_profile.sh`
- Behavioral tests: `tests/test_trader_completion_contract.py`
- Live profile canonical runner: `/Users/jarvis/.hermes/profiles/trader/scripts/trader-build-lab-canonical.sh`
- Active cron registry readback: `/Users/jarvis/.hermes/profiles/trader/cron/jobs.json` (13 enabled BUILD jobs; schedules unchanged)
- Live doctrine: `/Users/jarvis/.hermes/profiles/trader/SOUL.md`, trader-self-evolution skill/memory
- Coordinator route: `/Users/jarvis/.hermes/profiles/jarvis-coordinator/skills/agent-behavior/jarvis-coordinator-routing/SKILL.md`

## DURABLE

Future callers provide only `just trader-build-lab`. Trader loads one canonical goal, derives context, orients from durable state, and chooses the loop. Debug/recovery overrides remain but are not normal routing. Bootstrap recreates the same convergence without overwriting evolved Trader doctrine.

## VERIFICATION

- Preflight: `.venv/bin/python scripts/trader_run_completion_gate.py preflight --repo .` → ok on clean synchronized `main` before mutation.
- Shell syntax: `bash -n scripts/trader_build_lab_moa.sh scripts/trader_wake_moa.sh scripts/bootstrap_trader_profile.sh` → exit 0.
- Focused: `.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_trader_completion_contract tests.test_trader_run_completion_gate` → 16/16 OK.
- Full suite: `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests` → 95/95 OK.
- No-input assembly: `TRADER_BUILD_CONTEXT_ONLY=1 just trader-build-lab` → exact canonical goal, `goal_source=canonical`, `context_source=auto`.
- Live-profile smoke: canonical profile runner with `TRADER_BUILD_CONTEXT_ONLY=1` → exact current canonical goal.
- Active-cron convergence smoke: 13 enabled BUILD jobs / 8 script names each delegated with zero input and assembled the exact canonical goal.
- Override smoke: explicit `--goal` / `--slot` remained observable as override metadata.
- `git diff --check` → exit 0 before closeout.

## INTEGRATION

Implementation commit `46f5017cabdce5caa56b9edde8158cbe725d6484` was committed directly on `main`, pushed normally, fetched, and verified equal to `origin/main`. This completion-receipt update is the only follow-up delta; final remote equality, clean tree, and deterministic post-push preflight are verified after its commit/push. No branch or untracked residue remains.

## LESSON

Accepting no arguments is insufficient if the wrapper synthesizes a separate goal or cron/coordinator callers still inject judgment. Self-sufficiency requires one goal authority plus behavioral convergence at every caller boundary.

## NEXT

Observe the next scheduled BUILD launch and verify its `meta.json` records `goal_source=canonical` and `context_source=auto` with a Trader-chosen loop; treat any caller-supplied strategy judgment as a regression.

## GATES

None. No live/broker/paper order, gateway, schedule, secret, or strategy-evidence surface was touched.
