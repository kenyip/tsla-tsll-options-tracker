# Learning promotion — MoA 2026-07-16T0242

## VERIFICATION

Strategy charter/outcome:

- Frozen charter: `reports/trader-wakes/moa/2026-07-16T0242/strategy-charter.md`.
- Exact scope: `BEIGE_BOOK_RANGE_COMPRESSION_SPY_IC_21D_V1` / `BEIGE_BOOK_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_RANGE_COMPRESSION`.
- Outcome: `FAMILY_CLOSED` at F0. The 55-pair train population failed the frozen consistency gate at 27/55 = 49.0909% positive versus 55% required. The +0.252727% mean hurdle-adjusted compression and +0.009919% one-sided release-year LB90 remain diagnostic-only; holdout outcomes are unread and option pricing was not run.

Commands and exact results:

- `.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_beige_book_range_compression_train_lab tests.test_fomc_information_resolution_train_lab tests.test_trader_build_compounding tests.test_trader_build_progress tests.test_trader_run_completion_gate -v` -> `Ran 72 tests in 9.841s`, `OK`.
- `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests` -> `Ran 402 tests in 22.063s`, `OK`.
- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py scripts/trader_build_compounding.py tests/test_beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py tests/test_trader_build_compounding.py` -> exit 0.
- Two independent exact-byte-cache replays of `scripts/beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py` with 20,000 release-year-block bootstrap samples -> normalized SHA-256 `8d38697a70cff8d3c22199256ad353968121dc5859ddc2be9986b55ced6c1cd3` both times; `normalized_equal=True`, `strategy_outcome_family_closed=True`, `train_gate_fail_closed=True`, `holdout_outcomes_unread=True`, `option_pricing_not_run=True`.
- Canonical generated claim raw SHA-256 `e54a592b15e5bb22ae935ad4070a4aba590a9fecb587548f8c9d0e66b96042dd`; manifest raw SHA-256 `b561375eef832b3ba035192249d63de956ed27e5b8341dfdff8d35db2cc3bcc0`; normalized claim SHA-256 `8d38697a70cff8d3c22199256ad353968121dc5859ddc2be9986b55ced6c1cd3`.
- Match-quality reconstruction from all 55 pair rows is test-enforced: calendar distance median 73 / max 745 sessions; 15 pairs above 252 sessions; three absolute paired-compression differences above 5%; HV20-gap median 0.003936 / max 0.060838; absolute return60-gap median 0.002984 / max 0.052197.
- Final schema validation, deterministic prepare gate, diff/secret/debris scan, and remote/base state checks are recorded below after the artifacts they validate exist.

Challenger reconciliation:

- Accepted: preserve `FAMILY_CLOSED`; quarantine both canonical IDs; remove alias drift from living surfaces; keep LB90 diagnostic-only; preserve the no-option claim boundary; leave zero leaders/capital seats and NOT READY; use a two-close pivot reassessment as the sole NEXT.
- Repaired: added machine-readable matching-distance/extreme-pair evidence in `scripts/beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py` with row-level reconstruction tests; added completed-epoch `completed_stamp` upper-bound scoping in `scripts/trader_build_compounding.py` with an independent-wake exclusion regression.
- Rejected only as machinery defects, not on substance: the accepted strategy judgment, report naming, LB90/option/capital boundaries, readiness update, and finalizer-owned verification required report/process reconciliation rather than code repair. Exact status/rationale for all nine findings is machine-readable in `compounding.json`.

Integration remains pending the deterministic wrapper gate. This artifact is a green handoff candidate, not a `RUN COMPLETE` receipt.

## DURABLE

Repo files updated:

- `scripts/beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py` and `tests/test_beige_book_range_compression_train_lab.py`: reusable official-source train lab plus diagnostic match-quality summaries and reconstruction assertions.
- `scripts/trader_build_compounding.py` and `tests/test_trader_build_compounding.py`: completed search epochs retain context but cannot absorb records after inclusive `completed_stamp`.
- `reports/trader-wakes/moa/2026-07-16T0242/beige-book-official-manifest.json`, `beige-book-range-compression-train.json`, `strategy-charter.md`, `executor-closeout.md`, `challenger-critique.md`, `merged-next-seed.md`, `compounding.json`, and this file: dated source, claim, role judgment, reconciliation, structured outcome, and learning history.
- `reports/trader-wakes/2026-07-16T0242-moa-exec.md`, `reports/trader-wakes/2026-07-16T0242-moa-merge.md`, `reports/trader-wakes/LATEST.md`, `reports/trader-wakes/INDEX.md`, `reports/readiness/LATEST.md`, and regenerated coverage/progress/monitor reports: living project truth.

Profile promotion:

- Patched `trader-self-evolution` so completed epoch scoping must preserve `completed_stamp`, bound epoch records inclusively, and test that later independent wakes do not alter the completed-epoch streak.
- No profile memory addition: the dated family outcome belongs in repo evidence, and the reusable procedure belongs in the skill. Adding it to near-full global memory would duplicate and stale project truth.

No threshold, sign, horizon, regime, control, DTE, or option-wrapper retune was promoted. No holdout, option mark, registry mutation, paper intent, shadow, arm, broker, funding, or live authority was created.

## LESSON

Future Trader can now:

- separate official archive event identity, partial official same-day time corroboration, and next-session availability without laundering uncorroborated timestamps;
- build and replay an exact-byte, lag-safe, train-only scheduled-event range screen with prior-only one-to-one controls, no reuse, source-coverage/event-band exclusions, a sealed chronological holdout, and zero option pricing;
- expose coarse-match distance and extreme-pair sensitivity as machine-readable diagnostics without post-hoc moving frozen gates;
- treat a barely positive dependence-aware lower bound as necessary but insufficient when a predeclared population-consistency gate fails;
- preserve a completed search epoch as orientation context while bounding its counted records through `completed_stamp`, so later independent research cannot silently manufacture an epoch pivot signal.

Economic lesson: scheduled macro information resolution is not automatically a durable option-income edge. The completed FOMC bullish-drift mechanism and independent Beige Book range-compression mechanism both failed their frozen F0 bars. The next information gain comes from one explicit lane-level reassessment, not a third adjacent release selected by inertia.

## NEXT

`MACRO_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_TWO_CLOSE_PIVOT_REASSESSMENT`: reconcile the completed FOMC bullish-drift close with the independent Beige Book range-compression close. Treat CPI as adjacency context, not an order. Close exactly one decision: open a genuinely different CPI/inflation-surprise route only after freezing an accessible official prior-known source, coverage, time, control, uncertainty, and no-option F0 semantics before outcomes, or pivot away from scheduled macro information-resolution to a materially different non-quarantined mechanism/evidence class. Do not inspect either sealed holdout, retune either closed family, force an option wrapper, extend the completed FOMC epoch, or claim registry/paper/shadow/arm/broker/funding/live authority.
