# Trader platform readiness — latest

Updated: 2026-07-15 — MoA stamp 2026-07-15T2254 `RUN COMPLETE`; integrated/pushed/postflight-complete as `c96c2ed` with `main == origin/main` and a clean checkout.

Phase: BUILD
Sleeve: $3,000 Agentic research sleeve
Authority: research/paper-safe only; no shadow/live auto-promotion, broker access, funding, or live orders.

## Current strategy decision

- Finalizer outcome: exact `FAMILY_CLOSED` for `BROAD_SECTOR_BREADTH_THRUST_SPY_BULL_CALL_21D_V1` / `BROAD_SECTOR_BREADTH_THRUST_FORWARD_DRIFT` at `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`; strategy advancement false.
- Mechanism: sector breadth acceleration inside a positive SPY trend was hypothesized to produce incremental ten-session upside over high-breadth non-thrust controls.
- Conditional structure: future one-lot 18–24 DTE `$2`-wide SPY bull-call debit spread only after underlying train and later untouched-holdout evidence; no option stage ran.
- Capital context: `capital_fit_usd=$200`, same-expiry one-lot frictionless `max_loss_usd=$200` width/debit bound only when debit is `<= $200`, `max_lots=1`, and no overlapping SPY/QQQ/IWM or sector-option positive-delta Agentic risk. This is structural research context, not L1 admission.
- Fixed signal: completed SPY close above SMA100, positive 60-session return, sector breadth >=`9/11`, breadth increase >=`3/11` over five sessions, next completed-close entry.
- Prior-only control: same regime and breadth >=`9/11`, breadth change <=`1/11`, outcome-independent matching, no reuse/overlap, control exit before treated signal.
- Evidence: 34 frozen pairs on an inner-joined SPY + eleven-sector adjusted-close panel; train20 / holdout14 unread. XLC limits the common start to 2018-06-19.
- Train after labeled 10-bps underlying sensitivity: treated/control means `+0.245246%`/`+0.370614%`; paired mean `-0.125368%`; LB90 `-0.883946%`; positive frequency `65%`; thin worst-decile `n=2`, mean `-6.981542%`; integrity0.
- Year counts: `2019:3, 2020:4, 2021:8, 2022:1, 2023:4`; five years fail the frozen eight-year density gate. Do not drop XLC or loosen density after inspection.
- Match quality min/median/max: calendar sessions `12/68/360`; breadth `0/0/0.181818`; return-60 `0.006056/0.030272/0.102795`; HV-ratio `0.004050/0.245795/0.484548`. Controls are coarse prior-only matches, not tight local pairs.
- Failed gates: eight-year density, treated mean >`0.50%`, paired excess >=`0.25%`, positive paired LB90, thin worst-decile >=`-3%`, and treated superiority. Positive hit rate does not rescue absent incremental edge.
- Exact family and nearby same-panel 8–10/11 breadth, thrust/control-band, 5–15-session horizon, SMA50/SMA100, and same-novelty retunes are quarantined; reopening requires a materially new economic mechanism or evidence class.
- Holdout identity `c7012028...`; outcomes unread; option pricing0. No F1/F2/L1, living leader, capital seat, registry, paper intent, or B-check authority change.

## Parked observed candidate

- `TSLL_OBSERVED_TERM_CARRY_DIAGONAL_V1` remains candidate-scoped `EVIDENCE_WAIT` at F0.
- Current archive state from the last integrated run: 1,990 observed rows = 1,390 weekday-RTH + 600 non-RTH; 2 eligible RTH dates; 1 eligible 14–21 DTE short-expiry cycle; 0 complete paths; 0 frozen controls.
- Frozen wake floor remains >=12 distinct weekday-RTH dates, >=3 short-expiry cycles, >=20 complete non-overlapping paths, and >=8 frozen one-to-one controls; evaluate development 60% only and keep final 40% unread.
- `$300` remains an observed-diagonal admission budget, not structural loss proof; diagonal one-lot `max_loss_usd` is unproven under assignment/gap/exercise/liquidation.
- Black-Scholes and this breadth study cannot proxy-satisfy the observed-term-carry claim.

## Epoch / anti-thrash

- Active successor epoch started at 2026-07-15T2152 and remains active.
- After finalizer reconciliation: two completed strategy decisions, two consecutive no-advance outcomes, `strategy_pivot_required=true`, `strategy_burst_stop_required=false`; latest outcome is the independent breadth-thrust `FAMILY_CLOSED`.
- Next off-hours strategy decision must pivot to a materially different mechanism or evidence class outside sector-breadth / participation-thrust continuation and all integrated closed families.
- Pure distinct-RTH append reaffirmations for the parked diagonal retain `evidence_wait_reaffirmation=true` and do not add to the streak.
- Preserved sealed evidence: breadth holdout `c7012028...`, downside-semivariance `72a6d184...`, SPY option outcomes 2022-07-12..2026-07-13, and observed-diagonal final 40%.

## Evidence validity boundaries

- Breadth features use completed adjusted closes; entry is next completed close; no forward fill or option marks.
- Present-day fixed sector membership and listing survivorship are explicit; XLC listing truncates common history.
- Ten-session close-to-close underlying returns do not establish the full 18–24 DTE option path, IV/skew or IV crush, debit fills, assignment, intraday path, or early-exit performance.
- The labeled 10-bps underlying sensitivity is not an option transaction-cost model.
- The high-breadth non-thrust control is economically stronger on train; positive treated hit rate cannot rescue missing incremental edge.
- Current living leader remains none. Historical candidates and the future `$200` spread shape are context, not seats.

## Verification

- Repair TDD: machine-boolean assertion failed on the prior prose string, then passed after repair.
- New lab tests: 5/5 passed.
- Focused behavioral/boundary/negative-control/regression: 13 passed in 1.15s.
- Full unittest discovery: 373 passed in 19.168s.
- Full pytest: 383 passed, 18 subtests passed in 21.78s.
- Deterministic canonical regeneration: same economic metrics, failed gates, train pairs, and sealed holdout; finalizer artifact SHA-256 `0180dfe59ec20a8b6699116edc21ae20d57953520f5ebf03b1a7716df49252cf`.
- Coverage: 21 structures / 246 hypotheses / 70 evolve artifacts / no living leader; dated report `reports/readiness/income-coverage-2026-07-15T2334.md` and LATEST agree.
- Deterministic wrapper postflight: `ok=true`; integrated/pushed/postflight-complete as `c96c2ed`; `main == origin/main`; checkout clean; run branch deleted.

## Readiness blockers

1. No capital-path candidate has claim-appropriate after-cost option-payoff evidence plus path quality sufficient for L1/capital-seat authority.
2. The breadth-thrust family is closed at F0; its untouched reserve cannot be opened or same-panel retuned to salvage the claim.
3. The observed TSLL diagonal has 0 complete paths/controls and unproven structural max loss.
4. Broad observed historical option entry/exit joins remain unavailable; this blocks observed-option/L1 claims only, not unrelated L0 discovery.
5. Any future F3 candidate still requires live-clock paper quotes/fills before F4/shadow/live authority.
6. Stamp `2026-07-15T2254` is integrated/pushed/postflight-complete as `c96c2ed`; no execution authority changed.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

`TSLL_OBSERVED_TERM_CARRY_DATA_OR_MATERIALLY_DIFFERENT_L0_PIVOT`: use exactly one branch per wake—distinct weekday-RTH and frozen 12-date/3-cycle/20-path/8-control floor unmet -> append one provenance-safe all-expiration TSLL snapshot and report counters only (`EVIDENCE_WAIT`, reaffirmation streak-exempt); off-hours -> pivot to a materially different non-quarantined mechanism/evidence class outside sector-breadth directional continuation and all integrated closed families; observed floor met -> evaluate exact parked `TSLL_OBSERVED_TERM_CARRY_DIAGONAL_V1` development 60% and keep final 40% unread. No same-date churn, same-panel breadth retune, holdout salvage, registry/paper force, shadow, arm, broker, funding, or live action.
