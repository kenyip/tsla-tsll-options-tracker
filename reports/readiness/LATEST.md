# Trader platform readiness — latest

Updated: 2026-07-16 — MoA stamp 2026-07-15T2344 finalizer green handoff; deterministic commit/push/merge/postflight integration remains pending. No `RUN COMPLETE` claim.

Phase: BUILD
Sleeve: $3,000 Agentic research sleeve
Authority: research/paper-safe only; no shadow/live auto-promotion, broker access, funding, or live orders.

## Current strategy decision

- Finalizer outcome: exact `FAMILY_CLOSED` for `CROSS_SECTION_RESIDUAL_REVERSAL_BULL_CALL_21D_V1` / `CROSS_SECTION_FIVE_SESSION_RESIDUAL_REVERSAL` at `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`; strategy advancement false.
- Mechanism: the bottom three five-session peer residual laggards were hypothesized to rebound over the next five sessions relative to same-date neutral-residual peers.
- Conditional structure: future one-lot 18–24 DTE `$2`-wide bull-call debit spread only after underlying train and later untouched-holdout evidence; no option stage ran.
- Capital context: `capital_fit_usd=$200`, future same-expiry one-lot frictionless debit/max-loss ceiling `$200` only when debit is `<= $200`, `max_lots=1`, and no overlapping correlated positive-delta Agentic risk. Closing friction and observed/simulated option-path max loss are unmeasured; this is research context, not L1 admission.
- Fixed signal: 14-name adjusted-close panel; five-session stock return minus same-date panel median; bottom three only when treated mean residual <=`-4%`; three non-treated residuals nearest zero as controls; next completed-close entry; five-session exit; globally non-overlapping episodes.
- Evidence: 3,549 common sessions from 2012-06-01 through 2026-07-15, no forward fill; 240 frozen blueprints; train144 across 2012–2021; holdout96 outcome-unread.
- Train after labeled 20-bps underlying sensitivity: treated/control means `+1.340640%`/`+0.763662%`; paired mean `+0.576978%`; median `+0.720953%`; paired LB90 `+0.142252%`; treated positive frequency `66.6667%`; integrity0.
- Failed gate: treated worst-decile mean `-6.119049%` across 15 episodes versus required `>= -5%`.
- Dominant failure: positive average recovery did not control continuation tail risk. High-beta names were recurrent but not uniquely responsible; no post-inspection symbol deletion or gate loosening is permitted.
- Exact fixed-panel five-session residual-reversal expression, candidate, bottom-three/neutral-three construction, nearby `-4%` threshold, and nearby five-session feature/forward-horizon retunes are quarantined. Reopening requires a materially new mechanism or genuinely prior-known event taxonomy/labels/thresholds frozen before outcomes.
- Holdout identity `453bf4b...`; outcomes unread; option pricing0. No F1/F2/L1, living leader, capital seat, registry, paper intent, or B-check authority change.

## Parked observed candidate

- `TSLL_OBSERVED_TERM_CARRY_DIAGONAL_V1` remains candidate-scoped `EVIDENCE_WAIT` at F0.
- Current archive state from the last integrated run: 1,990 observed rows = 1,390 weekday-RTH + 600 non-RTH; 2 eligible RTH dates; 1 eligible 14–21 DTE short-expiry cycle; 0 complete paths; 0 frozen controls.
- Frozen wake floor remains >=12 distinct weekday-RTH dates, >=3 short-expiry cycles, >=20 complete non-overlapping paths, and >=8 frozen one-to-one controls; evaluate development 60% only and keep final 40% unread.
- `$300` remains an observed-diagonal admission budget, not structural loss proof; diagonal one-lot `max_loss_usd` is unproven under assignment/gap/exercise/liquidation.
- Black-Scholes and this underlying residual study cannot proxy-satisfy the observed-term-carry claim.

## Epoch / anti-thrash

- Active successor epoch started at 2026-07-15T2152 and remains active pending the required reassessment.
- Finalizer-reconciled state: three completed strategy decisions, three consecutive no-advance outcomes, `strategy_pivot_required=true`, `strategy_burst_stop_required=true`; latest outcome is the independent residual-reversal `FAMILY_CLOSED`.
- The next BUILD strategy wake must perform search-design/data reassessment before opening a successor epoch. Do not run a fourth volume search.
- Pure distinct-RTH append reaffirmations for the parked diagonal retain `evidence_wait_reaffirmation=true` and do not add to the streak.
- Preserved sealed evidence: residual-reversal holdout `453bf4b...`, breadth holdout `c7012028...`, downside-semivariance `72a6d184...`, SPY option outcomes 2022-07-12..2026-07-13, and observed-diagonal final 40%.

## Evidence validity boundaries

- Residual features use completed adjusted closes; entry is next completed close; no forward fill or option marks.
- Present-day fixed universe membership and listing survivorship are explicit.
- Same-date neutral residual controls test cross-sectional specificity but are not causal issuer matches.
- Five-session close-to-close underlying returns do not establish the full 18–24 DTE option path, IV/skew, IV crush, debit fills, assignment, intraday path, or early-exit performance.
- The labeled 20-bps underlying sensitivity is not an option transaction-cost model.
- Positive mean, paired excess, and bootstrap lower bound do not rescue the predeclared tail failure.
- Current living leader remains none. Historical candidates and the future `$200` spread shape are context, not seats.

## Verification

- New lab tests: 6/6 passed inside the focused suite.
- Focused behavioral/boundary/negative-control/regression: 37/37 passed in 6.921s.
- Full unittest discovery: 379/379 passed in 20.838s.
- Full pytest: 389 passed, 18 subtests passed in 23.16s.
- Compile and substantive cache replay passed; canonical finalizer artifact SHA-256 `fad32750fd051a57a1676b330034e0ef947bdc5fcc76124446d91a70891379fe`.
- Coverage: 21 structures / 246 hypotheses / 70 evolve artifacts / no living leader; dated report `reports/readiness/income-coverage-2026-07-16T0014.md` and LATEST agree.
- Finalizer green handoff only: no commit, push, merge, postflight, or `RUN COMPLETE`; deterministic wrapper integration remains pending.

## Readiness blockers

1. No capital-path candidate has claim-appropriate after-cost option-payoff evidence plus path quality sufficient for L1/capital-seat authority.
2. The residual-reversal family is closed at F0; its untouched reserve cannot be opened or nearby panel/threshold/horizon knobs retuned to salvage the claim.
3. Active-epoch burst stop requires reassessment before another strategy-volume search.
4. The observed TSLL diagonal has 0 complete paths/controls and unproven structural max loss.
5. Broad observed historical option entry/exit joins remain unavailable; this blocks observed-option/L1 claims only, not unrelated L0 discovery after reassessment.
6. Any future F3 candidate still requires live-clock paper quotes/fills before F4/shadow/live authority.
7. Stamp `2026-07-15T2344` is finalizer-ready but not deterministically integrated; no execution authority changed.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

`SEARCH_DESIGN_REASSESS_AFTER_RESIDUAL_REVERSAL_TAIL_CLOSE`: stop strategy-volume search; reconcile the three active-epoch no-advance outcomes, assess whether favorable centers with failed tails indicate a genuinely new prior-known event-risk evidence route or a broader data/design limitation, carry forward the parked observed-diagonal data floor without same-date churn, and start a successor epoch only after a dated reassessment names a non-quarantined mechanism or evidence class. Do not open the sealed 96-blueprint holdout, delete high-beta symbols post hoc, loosen the `-5%` tail gate, force registry/paper, or enter shadow/arm/broker/live paths.
