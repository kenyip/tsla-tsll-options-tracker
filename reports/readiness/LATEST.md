# Trader platform readiness — latest

Updated: 2026-07-15 19:08 local — MoA stamp 2026-07-15T1829 integrated, pushed, and postflight-complete on `main` / `origin/main`.

Phase: BUILD
Sleeve: $3,000 Agentic research sleeve
Authority: research/paper-safe only; no shadow/live auto-promotion, no broker access, no live orders.

## Decision readiness

- Latest finalized strategy outcome: `FAMILY_CLOSED` for exact `POST_EARNINGS_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_DRIFT` / `POST_EARNINGS_INFORMATION_RESOLUTION_DRIFT_CALL_DEBIT_21D_V1` at `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`.
- Frozen panel: AAPL, AMD, SMCI, TSLA, META, GOOGL, ARM, NVDA; TSLL excluded because it has no issuer earnings event. The present-day liquid operating-company panel has explicit survivorship/listing bias.
- Train evidence: `75` matched pairs across `7` symbols; event signed five-session mean `-0.0048312306693351955`, control `-0.0018400686017785396`, paired mean `-0.0029911620675566564`, paired median `0.007205961204603817`, LB90 `-0.016153603629205513`, and hit-rate edge `-0.013333333333333364`; integrity `[]`.
- Match diagnostics are now serialized: maximum/median calendar distance `420/70` sessions and `15/75` pairs with absolute paired excess at least 10%. These are diagnostic-only, not post-hoc gates; coarse/extreme matching cannot rescue the family because absolute event expectancy, paired mean, uncertainty bound, and hit edge all failed.
- The final `51` blueprints remain outcome-unread. Quarantine the exact unconditional signed-reaction continuation family; no threshold/panel churn, positive-median mining, sparse SMCI salvage, or holdout peek.
- Yahoo earnings timestamps are current retrospective records. They support explicit post-announcement BMO/AMC session alignment only, not historical known-at/pre-event scheduling alpha.
- No option marks, next-open fills, IV crush, multi-leg costs, managed PnL, or live-clock evidence were measured. Pricing calls remain `0`.
- This is the third consecutive completed post-advance strategy wake without `STRATEGY_ADVANCED` (1648 breakout expression close -> 1747 post-shock close -> 1829 post-earnings close). `strategy_pivot_required=true`; `strategy_burst_stop_required=true`.
- No living L1 candidate, quality leader, or capital seat. No phase, registry, paper, or B-check promotion.

## Current structural planning bound

The closed earnings mechanism never reached option pricing. Its future conditional expression was one lot of a 21-DTE `$2`-wide call debit spread after a positive reaction or put debit spread after a negative reaction:

- `capital_fit_usd = 200.0`
- structural one-lot `max_loss_usd = 200.0` before closing friction
- `max_lots = 1`
- one global earnings-risk unit and no overlapping event windows
- result: planning context only; not observed or simulated loss and not a capital-path seat.

## Current finalizer reconciliation

- Accepted challenger `PASS WITH NITS` and the exact `FAMILY_CLOSED` decision; preserved the sealed holdout and zero option authority.
- Kept the retrospective-versus-point-in-time boundary loud in the tracked claim, tests, readiness, and final reports.
- Repaired the methodology nits by serializing per-pair calendar/reaction/ret20/hv20 match gaps plus aggregate geometry/extreme-pair diagnostics, and by adding a strict-null zero-control-support negative control.
- Corrected stale streak/NEXT and wording: three post-advance no-advance strategy wakes, burst stop true, one search-design reassessment NEXT. The completed breakout epoch identity remains intact.
- Rejected threshold/symbol salvage, pre-event scheduling claims, capability-as-progress, and any capital-seat comparison against a nonexistent leader.
- Canonical income coverage uses run stamp `2026-07-15T1829`: 21 structures, 246 hypotheses, 70 evolve artifacts, no leader.

## Verification

- focused behavioral/boundary/negative-control/provenance/adjacent suite: `Ran 26 tests in 2.576s — OK`
- required final full suite after all surfaces: `unset GIT_INDEX_FILE; .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests` -> `Ran 349 tests in 17.891s — OK`; an earlier post-surface attempt inherited a removed disposable-index path, failed 11 fixture setup commits, and passed unchanged once the persisted environment was unset
- changed Python/test compile: exit `0`
- current-code tracked claim/cache replay substantive equality excluding only `generated_at`: `True`; normalized SHA-256 both `68454675f609da13816fa55f0a577027516b25d511bd5869baa200f8f62f7441`
- tracked claim raw SHA-256: `df7e80547438e6c7577e82c13de42c6419e61ad2fbfdf489431ac501e0d802c5`
- canonical coverage dated/LATEST byte equality: `True`
- schema-v2 handoff `ok=true` (`FAMILY_CLOSED`, 4 useful deltas, 7 critic findings closed); completion-gate regressions `38/38`; disposable-index prepare `ok=true` / 20 files; 16/16 source hashes; strict JSON; 272936-byte staged diff reviewed with empty `diff --check`, zero secret-pattern hits, and no sensitive/cache/temp/log paths. Final rerun is in learning; integration remains the wrapper's job.

## Readiness blockers

1. No capital-path candidate currently has robust after-cost option-payoff evidence plus path quality sufficient for an L1/capital seat.
2. The exact post-earnings continuation, post-shock compression, breakout bull-call expression, TOM, OPEX, and monthly-ranking families remain quarantined; reopening requires a genuinely new mechanism/evidence class, not threshold or panel churn.
3. A future pre-event fundamental-surprise/estimate-revision route requires point-in-time announcement, estimate, and revision data with honest known-at provenance. Current Yahoo retrospective timestamps do not qualify.
4. Broad observed historical option entry/exit joins remain unavailable for calibration. This blocks observed-option/L1 claims only, not labeled proxy discovery after the burst-stop reassessment.
5. Any future F3 candidate still requires live-clock paper quotes/fills before F4/shadow/live authority.
6. Stamp `2026-07-15T1829` is integrated and postflight-complete; no execution authority changed.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

BURST_STOP_SEARCH_DESIGN_REASSESSMENT: stop strategy-experiment volume. Diagnose the 1648 breakout-expression dual-cost/path close, 1747 post-shock compression close, and 1829 post-earnings continuation close; test whether current matched-control discovery is surfacing positive-median/adverse-tail families unsuitable for one-lot defined-risk income; inventory independent non-quarantined evidence classes; then open at most one successor epoch/charter with a complete Layered Edge Stack and predeclared falsifier before another strategy experiment. Do not rerun or threshold/panel-churn the closed post-earnings, post-shock, breakout-expression, TOM, OPEX, or monthly-ranking families. No registry, paper force, shadow, arm, broker, or live action.
