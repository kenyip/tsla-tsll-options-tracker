## Decision readiness

- Latest finalized strategy outcome: `FAMILY_CLOSED` for exact `LOW_DOWNSIDE_SEMIVARIANCE_ETF_PCS_21D_V1` at `F0_MECHANISM -> F0_MECHANISM`; strategy advancement false.
- Exact closed family: `noncollapse|cross_section_low_downside_semivariance_60d|liquid_etfs_spy_qqq_iwm_xlf_xle_xlk_xli_xlv|spy_sma100_uptrend_positive60d|10session_close_barrier5pct|pcs21d2wide_planned`.
- Fixed present-day panel: SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, XLK, XLI, XLV. It has survivorship, listing-history, composition-change, overlapping-fund, and current-universe bias; it is not a point-in-time investable population.
- Train: `178` globally non-overlapping rank dates from 2010-08-02 through 2019-10-29; all eight ETFs appeared low and seven appeared high; integrity `[]`; option-pricing calls `0`.
- Low/high 5% close-barrier breach rates: `4.4944% / 11.2360%`; semivariance edge `+6.7416pp`; one-sided 90% complete-rank-date block LB `+3.9326pp`.
- Low/high worst-decile minimum close returns: `-4.9172% / -8.0647%`; low terminal mean after labeled 20 bps underlying sensitivity `+0.4595%`.
- Same-date plain-HV edge: `+7.8652pp`; semivariance-minus-plain-HV specificity margin `-1.1236pp`; same low/high selection `134/178` and `141/178`.
- Sole failed gate: `semivariance_edge_exceeds_plain_hv`. Dominant failure is mechanism non-specificity only; absolute hazard, relative edge, date-block uncertainty, tail, breadth, density, and integrity passed.
- Holdout: `119` blueprints with rank dates 2019-11-13 through 2026-06-16 and exits through 2026-07-02 remains outcome-unread under identity `72a6d18430031f03421d27a2680f53d42f099357a5c6685b1b3db2ce1a7dcd5d`.
- Low ranks were concentrated in SPY (`83/178`) and XLV (`60/178`); high ranks in XLE (`107/178`). Concentration is labeled and narrows authority; it does not rescue or invalidate the exact in-sample family close.
- Daily-close barriers can miss intraday lows and are not option marks, executable stops, managed PCS PnL, or fill evidence. The 20-bps underlying sensitivity is not option cost evidence.
- No F1/F2/L1 candidate, living quality leader, capital seat, registry promotion, paper intent, or B-check change.

## Current structural planning bound

The closed mechanism never reached option pricing. Its future conditional expression was one lot of a put credit spread on the nearest listed 18–24 DTE expiry, with a 0.18–0.25 delta short put and same-expiry long put `$2` lower, at least `$0.30` credit, positive bids, and two-leg NBBO width at most `$0.20`:

- `capital_fit_usd = 200.0`
- structural one-lot `max_loss_usd = 200.0` before credit and closing friction
- `max_lots = 1`
- one global correlated bullish risk unit
- result: planning context only; not observed/simulated option loss and not a capital-path seat.

## Current finalizer reconciliation

- Accepted challenger `PASS WITH NITS`, the exact family close, and L0 authority boundary.
- Repaired claim-bearing dominant-failure prose and regression-tested the specificity-only path.
- Distinguished holdout rank-date coverage from later exit-date coverage.
- Rejected executor plain-HV barrier continuation as the durable NEXT.
- Quarantined the closed semivariance family plus nearby lookback/barrier/panel retunes; preserved closed recent-downshock and low-HV mean-return families; kept holdout `72a6d184…` sealed.
- Active epoch `2026-07-15-tail-hazard-discovery` now has two consecutive no-advance wakes (`1912`, `2007`); `strategy_pivot_required=true`; a third consecutive no-advance forces burst-stop reassessment.
- Canonical income coverage uses run stamp `2026-07-15T2007`: 21 structures, 246 hypotheses, 70 evolve artifacts, no leader.

## Verification

- focused strategy behavioral/boundary/negative-control/integrity suite: `Ran 7 tests in 0.137s — OK`
- focused finalizer-adjacent suite: `Ran 57 tests in 7.523s — OK`
- required full suite: `Ran 363 tests in 18.244s — OK`
- compile and CLI-help smoke: exit `0`, no output
- current-code claim replay: exit `0`; `FAMILY_CLOSED`; train `178`; failed gate exactly `semivariance_edge_exceeds_plain_hv`; tracked/replay substantively equal excluding only `generated_at`; normalized SHA-256 `2f1dc94161b361b1725f92d91eb63b32dc0686d87a7f52bf582a24e123cf48a2`; all source hashes and holdout identity equal
- canonical coverage: `21` structures / `246` hypotheses / `70` evolve artifacts / no leader; dated and LATEST byte-identical
- schema-v2 handoff: `ok=true`, `role_ready=true`, outcome `FAMILY_CLOSED`, four useful deltas, six critic findings closed
- complete 20-path diff/security review and disposable-index completion prepare: diff check clean; prepare `ok=true`, branch `trader/run-2026-07-15T2007`, staged files `20`; no sensitive/private/unintended path found

## Readiness blockers

1. No capital-path candidate has robust after-cost option-payoff evidence plus path quality sufficient for an L1/capital seat.
2. The exact downside-semivariance ETF family and nearby rank lookback/barrier/panel retunes are quarantined. Plain HV from the inspected partition cannot be relabeled as a successor family.
3. The recent-downshock timer, low-HV mean-return, post-earnings continuation, post-shock compression, breakout bull-call expression, TOM, OPEX, and monthly-ranking families remain closed absent a genuinely new mechanism/evidence class.
4. Present evidence is fixed-panel, concentrated, close-only, underlying-only L0. It cannot grant F1/F2/L1, paper, or capital authority.
5. Broad observed historical option entry/exit joins remain unavailable for calibration. This blocks observed-option/L1 claims only, not labeled proxy discovery.
6. Any future F3 candidate still requires live-clock paper quotes/fills before F4/shadow/live authority.
7. Stamp `2026-07-15T2007` is integrated and postflight-complete; no execution authority changed.

## Exactly one NEXT seed

`SPY_INDEX_THETA_CARRY_PCS_21D_DUAL_COST_F0`: freeze a regime-only SPY one-lot 18–24 DTE `$2`-wide PCS (short 0.18–0.25 delta, minimum `$0.30` credit, positive bids, two-leg NBBO width `≤$0.20` when quotes exist, 50% harvest, 5% underlying-close invalidation, hard approximately ten-session stop), `capital_fit_usd=$200`, structural `max_loss_usd=$200` before credit/friction, `max_lots=1`; evaluate chronological train then untouched holdout proxy option path PnL under both 5% adverse leg slip and `$0.01`-per-leg half-spread with non-vacuous trade, max-loss, window-DD, chronology, and integrity gates. No cross-sectional HV/semivariance rank, no use of holdout `72a6d184…`, and no L1, registry, paper force, shadow, arm, broker, or live action from proxy evidence.
