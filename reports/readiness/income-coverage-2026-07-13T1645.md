## Gaps (BUILD targets)

- calendar_spread — explicit front/back IV + put-skew assumptions and chronological OOS built; observed historical option-surface inputs missing
- double_diagonal_spread — same-strike/inward protective four-leg BS daily-bar scaffold with American intrinsic floors, signed four-leg percentage/fixed-dollar costs, observed-path loss capital sizing, enforced one-lot operating cap with theoretical capacity separately labeled, and a reproducible eight-symbol chronological reject-unless lab built; 0/8 symbols passed both train/holdout cost axes, no hypothesis was registered, and observed option surfaces/assignment calibration remain missing
- diagonal_spread — BS defined-debit scaffold + B3/B4 + exact-DNA OOS/density plus announcement-time dividend/short-call assignment boundary built; AAPL has bounded 40/40 issuer corroboration for announcement date/amount/common-stock identity from 2016-07-26 through 2026-04-30, while the independent explicit-ex-date inventory covered only the latest 20/40 target events and closed that narrow route at partial L0; ambiguous/unsupported symbols fail closed and observed option surfaces remain missing
- convex/ratio family — long call, symmetric/broken-wing credit iron butterflies, and a 1x2 put ratio backspread have B3/B4/fixed-cost dispatch; ratio cost survivors still fail absolute DD/risk gates, and observed surfaces/assignment remain missing
- debit_vertical — bull-call and bear-put BS defined-debit scaffold + evolve/B3/B4 built; bull-call can use the archived Nasdaq declaration-date provider on supported eventful listings with bounded AAPL issuer corroboration for announcement date/amount/common-stock identity only, while the explicit-ex-date inventory was incomplete at 20/40 and observed surfaces plus short-put assignment remain missing
- collared_covered_call — capital-honest scaffold plus 1,152-row DTE/delta/management grid built; 258 rows were positive on both proxy cost axes but zero met the $75 window-DD gate, so the family is rejected this cycle; dividends/assignment unmodeled and no proxy SHIP registered
- time-bucket scoreboard — multi-hyp DTE/profit-target/DTE-stop + entry-weekday/cost grid plus a completed-30-minute open/midday/late PCS/CCS/IC chronological dual-cost lab are built; append-safe 30-minute and daily-feature archives produced 60 usable dates from 60 raw dates (36 train / 24 holdout), but the locked 8-symbol rerun still rejected at L0 with only 1/24 train dual-cost passes and 0/24 complete train+holdout passes
- direction/volatility-bias lab — shared-window scoreboard + no-lookahead shared-position PCS/CCS/IC router built; asymmetric capped-jade IC, daily close-shock/momentum/pullback/vol-compression PCS, multi-horizon trend-pullback PCS, and bearish volatility-expansion CCS families failed complete proxy gates, so they remain rejected pending a genuinely new edge or observed-data density
- cost realism — exact PCS/CCS/IC leg/time join + reject gate, Friday abstraction, archive-backed date-aware expiry/strike-grid provider, and all-expiration atomic append capture built; density gate fails closed below three market dates, and the current TSLL archive covers 2/3 dates, so provider-backed historical simulation and observed-cost calibration remain blocked

## BUILD lab recipe

1. Dual MoA: `just trader-build-lab`
2. Rotate under-covered structures / time / direction axes
3. Falsify new SHIP with B3+B4 + ml/dd quality bar
4. RTH: wait for filters → paper open/close only

Paper/research only. No live.
